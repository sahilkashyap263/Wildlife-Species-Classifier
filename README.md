# WLDS-9 — Multi-Modal Species Identification System

> ⚠️ **This project is currently under active development and is NOT production-ready.**
> All inference engines are running in **dummy/simulation mode** — they return realistic randomised outputs, not real model predictions. Trained models are being prepared separately on Kaggle. This codebase exists to validate the architecture, fusion logic, and execution pipeline before real models are integrated.

---

A software-first simulation of an AI-powered wildlife identification device using multi-modal sensor fusion. Built to validate the core intelligence pipeline — audio classification, image classification, distance estimation, and weighted fusion — before hardware integration.

## Project Identity

| Property | Value |
|---|---|
| **System Name** | Multi-Modal Species Identification System |
| **Short Code** | WLDS-9 |
| **Stage** | Models complete — Docker & hosting pending |
| **Goal** | Prove multi-modal fusion logic and edge AI execution pipeline |

## Architecture

```
Frontend (Browser)
    ↓
Flask REST API  (app.py)
    ↓
Core Inference Engine  (core/inference.py)
    ├── audio_engine.py    → CNN on Mel-spectrogram
    ├── image_engine.py    → MobileNet/ResNet transfer learning
    ├── distance_engine.py → Acoustic regression model
    └── fusion_engine.py   → Weighted confidence fusion
    ↓
SQLite Database  (wlds9.db)
    ↓
Detection History Page  (/history)
```

**Golden Rule:** Flask never contains ML logic. All intelligence lives in `core/`.

## Setup & Run

### 1. Create virtual environment

```bash
python3 -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate
```

### 2. Install dependencies

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### 3. Test inference engine (CLI — no server needed)

```bash
python core/inference.py --mode audio
python core/inference.py --mode image
python core/inference.py --mode fusion
```

### 4. Start Flask server

```bash
python app.py
```

## API Endpoints

| Method | Route | Description |
|---|---|---|
| `GET` | `/` | Landing page |
| `GET` | `/scanner` | Main scanner UI (authenticated) |
| `GET` | `/history` | Detection history page |
| `POST` | `/analyze/audio` | Audio-only species scan |
| `POST` | `/analyze/image` | Image-only species scan |
| `POST` | `/analyze/fusion` | Full multi-modal scan |
| `GET` | `/logs` | Query SQLite logs (`?limit=`, `?mode=`) |
| `GET` | `/logs/stats` | Aggregate stats (top species, avg confidence) |
| `POST` | `/logs/clear` | Wipe all detection logs |

---

## Analysis Modes

### Audio Mode
- **Input:** WAV / MP3 / M4A / WebM file or live 15-second microphone recording
- **Output:** Species, confidence, estimated distance, distance label

### Visual Mode
- **Input:** JPG / PNG / WebP or live webcam capture
- **Output:** Species, confidence, habitat zone, activity level, size class, frame coverage

### Fusion Mode
- **Input:** Audio + Image simultaneously
- **Output:** Fused species prediction with agreement/conflict detection
- **Formula:** `D = (c₁·d₁ + c₂·d₂ + c₃·d₃) / (c₁ + c₂ + c₃)`
- **Weighting:** 58% image / 42% audio; agreement boosts confidence 10%, conflict applies 5% penalty

## Auth System

- Register with email — username is derived from the email prefix automatically
- Passwords are hashed (bcrypt) before storage
- Admin role supported via `is_admin` flag in the `users` table
- An admin account is seeded automatically on first run — **change the default credentials immediately**
- Login/register available as a full-page view (`auth.html`) or inline modal on the landing page (`auth_modal.css`)
- Session-based authentication — scanner dashboard is inaccessible without login
- Welcome toast shown on first login after registration
- Admin badge displayed in the scanner header for admin accounts

---

## Database Reference

All detections are stored in `wlds9.db` (SQLite — no extra install needed).

### 1. Access the database in bash terminal

```bash
sqlite3 wlds9.db
```

### 2. List all tables

```bash
.tables
```

| Table | Description |
|---|---|
| `detection_logs` | Scan history — one row per detection |
| `users` | Auth table — registered user accounts |

### 3. SQLite Query to Fetch History Records

```sql
SELECT id, timestamp, mode, species, confidence, distance, distance_label, logged_by
FROM detection_logs
WHERE is_error = 0
ORDER BY id DESC
LIMIT 20;
```

### 4. Delete From a User Table

```sql
DELETE FROM detection_logs;
DELETE FROM sqlite_sequence WHERE name='detection_logs';
```

### 5. For more commands, type `.help`

---

### Other Useful Queries

**Count scans per user:**
```sql
SELECT logged_by, COUNT(*) as total_scans
FROM detection_logs
WHERE is_error = 0
GROUP BY logged_by
ORDER BY total_scans DESC;
```

**Delete a specific user:**
```sql
DELETE FROM users WHERE username = 'example_user';
```

> **Recommended GUI:** Install the **SQLite Viewer** extension in VS Code and click `wlds9.db` to browse all data visually.

## Dataset Sources

| Purpose | Dataset | Link |
|---|---|---|
| Bird audio | xeno-canto | https://xeno-canto.org |
| Bird images | iNaturalist | https://www.inaturalist.org |
| Audio (Kaggle) | BirdCLEF 2024 | https://www.kaggle.com/competitions/birdclef-2024 |
| Animal images | Animals Detection Dataset | https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/antoreepjana/animals-detection-images-dataset |

---

## Current Limitations

| Component | Current State | Target State |
|---|---|---|
| `fusion_engine.py` | Weighted fusion logic complete | Fine-tune agreement/conflict thresholds with real-world data |
| Species info panel | Hardcoded lookup table in `app.js` | Serve from DB / species API |
| Conservation data | Static, manually curated | Pull from IUCN Red List API |
| Deployment | Local only | Docker + cloud hosted |

---

## Future Transition

| Current | Replace With |
|---|---|
| Flask | FastAPI or embedded service |
| PyTorch `.pt` | TensorFlow Lite (edge deployment) |
| File uploads | Live sensor streams (microphone array + camera module) |
| SQLite | PostgreSQL or time-series DB |

Core fusion logic remains unchanged — that is the key asset.

---

## Tech Stack

| Layer | Technology |
|---|---|
| Backend | Python 3, Flask |
| ML Models | Audio CNN, Image CNN (MobileNet/ResNet), GBR distance regression |
| Database | SQLite (`wlds9.db`) |
| Frontend | Vanilla JS, CSS3, Font Awesome 6, Google Fonts (Inter + JetBrains Mono) |
